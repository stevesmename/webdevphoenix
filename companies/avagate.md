The Avagate web platform hosts vendors and independent contractors to provide product and services to clients as requirements are found during a project lifecycle. The mission is to strengthen talented individuals, allowing them to work cohesively instead of independently.

Hiring full-time and part-time developers, we are interested in finding the individual who is still learning. We are not impressed by experts who bloat themselves more than the open source they use.

additionally always seeking independent contractors. As a contractor, you decide your hourly rate and we provide available work from our clients and projects.
